## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** â€” The user sets up moderation keywords and action rules in the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** â€” Appilot connects to the Threads app on real devices or emulators, scanning new comments and classifying them using NLP and rule-based models.  
3. **Output or Action** â€” When a match is found, the bot hides, deletes, or flags the comment based on the selected rule.  
4. **Other functionalities** â€” Detailed logs, retry mechanisms, and proxy-based separation ensure reliability across thousands of comments daily.
